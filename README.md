# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

It is made using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX for the front-end, and Node and Express for the back-end.

Create your own tweets to be displayed with a randomly generated avatar that has its own name and @ handle, it includes a toggle button to show or hide the text area, a button that takes you back to the top of the page, with hover effects on the tweets and also on the tweet reactions!
